          note: >
            Referring Page URI (`document.referrer`) whenever available. The user agent SHOULD NOT send the fragment
            (`#` followed by more data) portion of the URI.
          brief: This attribute represents the referring page (if available).
        - id: title
          brief: >
            This attribute represents the title of the page that was viewed.
          note: >
            The document title (`document.title`) of the page that was viewed. It MAY be equal to the `url` attribute
            or empty if it is not applicable.
          type: string
          examples: ['Wikipedia - The Free Encyclopedia']
        - ref: http.url
          alias: url
          note: >
            Full HTTP request URL in the form `scheme://host[:port]/path?query[#fragment]`. Usually the fragment is
            not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it should be included nevertheless. The fragment may be
            used for `virtual_page`s to disambiguate pages with the same URL (e.g., due to pagination).
          brief: >
            This attribute represents the URL of the page that was viewed.
          examples: ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#foo']

            This attribute represents the state the application has transitioned into at the occurrence of the event.
          note: >
            This identifies the type of page view. For example, if the page view represents a user 
          type:
            allow_custom_values: false
            members:
              - id: physical_page
                value: '0'
                brief: >
                  Initial page load within the browser and will generally also precede a PageNavigationTiming event.
              - id: virtual_page
                value: '1'
                brief: >
                  This is for Single Page Applications (SPA) where the framework provides the ability to perform
                  client side only page "navigation", the exact definition of what a virtual page change is determined
                  by the SPA and the framework it is using.
